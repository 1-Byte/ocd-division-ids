# Open Civic Data Division Identifiers (OCD-ID)

The goal of this project is to assign somewhat predictable and globally unique identifiers to political divisions.

The canonical documentation of OCD-IDs is expressed as [OCDEP 2: Open Civic Data Divisions](https://github.com/opencivicdata/proposals/blob/master/ocdeps/0002.rst).
